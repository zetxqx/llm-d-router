// Saturation refreshes the pod ledger from the live endpoint list and always
// returns 0.0.
//
// Returning 0 is deliberate: the flow controller's saturation gate is a
// band-level head-of-line block, and while it reports saturated nothing
// dispatches, including the turns of sessions already admitted. Those turns
// are what complete trajectories and free capacity, so blocking them can
// only stall the pool. The per-session gate lives in Pick instead, where an
// admitted session's turn can be told apart from a new one. This hook is
// used because it is the only flow-control callback that receives the
// endpoint list each dispatch cycle. There is no pause sweep: Pick pauses
// idle sessions on demand, when a picked turn needs their room.
