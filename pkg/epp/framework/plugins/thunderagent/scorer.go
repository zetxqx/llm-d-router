// Score is piecewise. A program the fairness policy just admitted carries a
// reservation naming the pod that fit it; that pod scores 1.0 so the pod
// admitted onto and the pod picked agree. Otherwise a program bound to a
// candidate pod scores that pod 1.0 and all others 0.0 (sticky; paused
// programs keep their origin binding), while an unbound or displaced program
// scores pods by free decayed token capacity (least-loaded placement).
// Anonymous requests are not scored; pair this plugin with a general load
// scorer to account for them.
//
// Keeping the binding and the accounting in one table means re-placement is
// inherent: when a scheduling filter removes the bound pod from the
// candidates, the sticky branch misses, the load branch places the program
// elsewhere, and PreRequest rebinds it to the pod actually picked.
